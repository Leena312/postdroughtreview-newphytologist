Published in New Phytologist: DOI pending

This data was collected by Leena L Vilonen, Maggie Ross, and Melinda Smith. We used Web of Science to extract each paper from a web search in February 2021. All data is collected in one spreadsheet (LegacyEffectsReviewPaperFinal.xcl). A word document with the citations of each paper is also uploaded (Citations.dox). In our spreadsheet (LegacyEffectsReviewPaperFinal.xcl), you will find collected data in order of columns on: 

1. The citation for each paper
2. The coordinates of the study
3. The ecosystem type (grassland, forest, etc)
4. Whether the study was arid of mesic
5. Whether the study looked above or belowground measurements
6. Whether the study used a greenhouse, lab, field, or remote sensing experiment
7. The amount of precipitation the study reduced
8. The length of the drought observed or imposed
9. Whether the study had one or two droughts imposed in their study
10. The time after the drought that the paper measured the response
11. Which term they used to describe their response after drought
12. How they define the term used to describe their response
13. Whether abiotic or biotic mechanisms were cited for the response seen
14. Whether the response after drought was positive, negative, or neutral
15. What their general findings were
16. Any notes we deemed necessary to add
